# Overview

CushionDB is an open source, easy-to-use data management framework for building small, offline-first, PWA compliant applications. It simplifies the process of managing and persisting single-user data without writing any server-side database code and provides user authentication capabilities that are crucial for efficient client-side data management.

CushionDB expands on current offline-first data models by employing different PWA tools that ensure data integrity regardless of network connectivity, and abstracts many of the complexities around utilizing these tools for native-like client side data management.

CushionClient is designed to work with [CushionSever](https://github.com/CushionDB/CushionServer) and a pre-configured CouchDB we call [CushionCouch](https://github.com/CushionDB/CushionCouchDocker). Both CushionServer and CushionCouch are setup as Docker images and can easily be built, configured and run using a simple script provided by CushionDB.

## CushionDB Architecture

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 10.16.3 - *CushionClient*
* Docker - *CushionServer and CushionCouch*

## Install

```
npm i cushion-client
mv node_modules/cushion-client/sw.js .
```

## Setup

CushionClient is an npm package. It can either be added to the projects node modules by running `npm i cushion-client` from within your project's root directory, or `cushion-client` can simply be added as a dependency inside your project's `package.json` file.

 Once CushionClient has been added as a dependency, changes can be made to the `.couchConfig.json` file within the `node_modules/cushion-client` directory. This is only necessary if the default server configurations are changed while setting up the CushionDB backend.

The URLs in this config file will be used for networking with the two backend containers and the Public VAPID key is needed for PWA Push Notifications to work.

Finally, a Service Worker file (`sw.js`) is needed in the project's root directory. This file comes packaged with the `cushion-client` node module and can be moved to your current project's root directory by running `mv node_modules/cushion-client/sw.js .` from the command line.

## Sample Usage

```js
import Cushion from 'cushiondb';
// or
const Cushion = require('cushiondb');
```

```js
// instantiate a new CushionDB object
const cushion = new Cushion();

// sign up a new user
cushion.account.signUp({
  username: 'jDoe',
  password: 'secret'
 });
 
 // add a document to the database
cushion.store.set({
  title: 'todo',
  completed: false
 }).then(id => {
  // do something
 }).catch(err => {
 // handle error
});
```
