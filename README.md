# Overview

CushionDB is an open source, easy-to-use data management framework for building small, offline-first, PWA compliant applications. It simplifies the process of managing and persisting single-user data without writing any server-side database code and provides user authentication capabilities that are crucial for efficient client-side data management.

CushionDB expands on current offline-first data models by employing different PWA tools that ensure data integrity regardless of network connectivity, and abstracts many of the complexities around utilizing these tools for native-like client side data management.

CushionClient is designed to work with [CushionSever](https://github.com/CushionDB/CushionServer) and a pre-configured CouchDB we call [CushionCouch](https://github.com/CushionDB/CushionCouchDocker). Both CushionServer and CushionCouch are setup as Docker images and can easily be built and run using `docker-compose up` from within the [CushionDocker](https://github.com/CushionDB/CushionDocker) directory.
